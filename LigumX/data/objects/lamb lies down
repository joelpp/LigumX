And the lamb lies down on Broadway

A
Early morning Manhattan
A
Ocean winds blow on the land
C#m
The Movie-Palace is now undone
Dsus2
The all-night watchmen have had their fun
C#m
Sleeping cheaply on the midnight show
Dsus2
It's the same old ending - time to go
A Adim
Get out!

Ab
It seems they cannot leave their dream
Abm7
There's something moving in the sidewalk steam
Eb				  E4		A
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Nightime's flyers feel their pains

Drugstore takes down the chains

Metal motion comes in bursts

But the gas station can quench that thirst

Suspension cracked on unmade road

The trucker's eyes read 'Overload'

And out of the subway

Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid

Exits into daylight, spraygun hid

And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Dmaj7
The lamb seems right out of place
Amaj7									Dmaj7
Yet the Broadway street scene finds a focus in its face
-2013-A7
Somehow it's lying there
F#
Brings a stillness to the air
F#m G F#m G 			D Em F#m G
Though man-made light, at night is very bright
Em
There's no whitewash victim
Dmaj7 								A Adim
As the neons dim, to the coat of white
Ab 		
Rael Imperial Aerosol Kid
Abm7
Wipes his gun-he's forgotten what he did
Eb 				E4 			A
And the lamb lies down on Broadway

Dm 
Something...
